Building a Modular, Extensible Text2SQL Backend with Dynamic Metadata Retrieval

Design and implement a backend service in Python that converts natural language queries into executable SQL for a Postgres SQL database. The core objective is to enable non-technical users to query database tables using plain language while ensuring generated SQL is accurate, secure, and grounded in the latest table schema metadata.

Key requirements include:
	1.	Modular Architecture:
	•	Develop distinct components for request handling, LLM integration, SQL generation, dynamic metadata retrieval, and database connectivity.
	•	Ensure clear interfaces between modules to enable easy replacement, extension, or testing of individual components.
	2.	Multi-LLM Connectivity:
	•	Create an abstraction layer that supports integration with multiple LLM providers.
	•	Design a uniform API for LLM calls that handles authentication, endpoint configuration, and prompt templating.
	•	Implement fallback strategies to gracefully handle timeouts or failures from any single LLM.
	3.	Dynamic Metadata Retrieval:
	•	Build a middleware module that dynamically fetches and caches the latest database schema metadata prior to processing a query.
	•	Inject relevant metadata (e.g., table names, column types, relationships) into the prompt to guide the LLM in generating syntactically and semantically correct SQL.
	•	Optimize retrieval to include only the necessary metadata based on the incoming query context, balancing prompt length and detail.
	4.	SQL Generation and Validation:
	•	Use LLM responses to generate SQL queries tailored for Presto SQL, ensuring that the generated queries reflect the current schema.
	•	Validate the generated SQL against the metadata to catch errors or potential injection vulnerabilities before execution.
	5.	Asynchronous Processing & Performance:
	•	Leverage asynchronous frameworks (e.g., FastAPI with uv loop) to handle concurrent requests efficiently.
	•	Implement connection pooling for database interactions and caching mechanisms to reduce latency and API costs.
	6.	Robust Error Handling & Logging:
	•	Design comprehensive error handling across all modules—from LLM communication to SQL execution—and log relevant metrics to aid troubleshooting and performance tuning.
	7.	Package Management & Dependency Handling:
	•	Use uv for package management, ensuring a clean, reproducible environment and straightforward dependency updates.
	8.	Testing & Extensibility:
	•	Write extensive unit and integration tests for all modules to ensure reliability, especially for SQL generation and metadata grounding.
	•	Ensure the design supports future enhancements, including adding new LLM connectors, expanding metadata sources, or integrating additional query validation layers.

- This must conform to software engineering best practices including OOP.
- For this initial proof of concept, just utilize OpenAI's LLM but build abstract core models where each implementation inherits from these core models.
